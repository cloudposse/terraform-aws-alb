## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb/releases).


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated test of the complete example using `bats` and `Terratest`, see [test](test).
