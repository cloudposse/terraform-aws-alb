# terraform-aws-alb  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to create an ALB, default ALB listener(s), and a default ALB target and related security groups.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).




## Usage

Include this module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "alb" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb.git?ref=tags/0.2.0"
  namespace          = "eg"
  name               = "app"
  stage              = "dev"

  vpc_id             = "xxxxxxxxx"
  ip_address_type    = "ipv4"

  subnet_ids         = ["xxxxxxxx", "xxxxxxxx"]
  access_logs_region = "us-west-2"
}
```






## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                This help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  lint                                Lint terraform code
